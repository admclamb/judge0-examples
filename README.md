# judge0-examples

These are examples and some useful tools for working/debugging judge0.

## Getting Started

Run the command: `cp .env.example .env` to create the .env file. Next, fill out the api key inside the env file (or SULU key). \*\_For sulu, update the JUDGE0_CE_BASE_URL or JUDGE0_EXTRA_CE_BASE_URL\*

### Mocha Chai Example

To use mocha and chai in a judge0 submission, first you need to setup the additional files that contain the package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules.
